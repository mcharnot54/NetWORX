# TL Data Extraction Results

## Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis of your data files, here's what I found in the data processor:

### Files Found
- **2 TL files** detected with the correct name: "2024 TOTALS WITH INBOUND AND OUTBOUND TL (2).xlsx"
- **24 total files** in the database 
- Both TL files have processed data available

### Current Status
- ✅ TL files successfully identified
- ✅ Data has been processed and stored
- ❌ Baseline extraction needs to be completed (processing status showing "failed" but data exists)

### Data Processor Contents
The system found your TL files in the data processor with:
- File ID 36: Latest TL file (scenario 2)
- File ID 12: Duplicate TL file (scenario 2) 
- Processing status shows data is available for extraction

### Next Steps Required
1. **Navigate to TL Data Check page**: Visit `/tl-data-check` to run the baseline extraction
2. **Review extracted baseline**: The system will show you the actual 2025 baseline found in your TL file
3. **Update Transport Optimizer**: Use the extracted baseline instead of the estimated $5.5M

### Expected Baseline Value
The system is looking for:
- Values over $1M in freight/transport/cost columns
- Column names containing "freight", "transport", "cost", "total", or "spend"
- The largest value will be used as your 2025 baseline

## Current Transport Optimizer Status
- Using estimated baseline: $5.5M (needs to be replaced)
- Waiting for actual baseline from your TL file
- Once extracted, will show year-by-year projections (2025-2032) with proper baseline

## Resolution
The TL data is in the data processor and ready for extraction. Visit the TL Data Check page to complete the baseline extraction process.
