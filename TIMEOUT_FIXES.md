# Timeout Fixes & Emergency Recovery

This document describes the timeout issues and the comprehensive fix system implemented.

## üö® Quick Fix for Request Timeouts

If you're experiencing request timeouts, use one of these immediate solutions:

### Option 1: In the Web UI
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Look for the "Timeout Health Monitor" component on the main page
3. Click "Emergency Fix" button

### Option 2: API Endpoint
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ping-timeout-fix

# Trigger emergency fix
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ping-timeout-fix
```

### Option 3: Multiple Endpoints Available
```bash
# Emergency fix with full report
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/emergency-fix

# Timeout status and statistics  
curl http://localhost:3000/api/timeout-status

# Timeout monitoring diagnostics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/timeout-monitor
```

## üîç What the Emergency Fix Does

The emergency fix system automatically:

1. **Clears all pending timeouts** - Removes stuck timeout handlers
2. **Resets request monitoring** - Clears timeout tracking statistics
3. **Forces garbage collection** - Frees up memory if usage is high
4. **Applies emergency timeout configurations** - Sets up error handlers
5. **Provides health assessment** - Reports system status and recommendations

## üìä Health Status Levels

- **üü¢ Healthy**: All systems normal, no action needed
- **üü° Degraded**: Minor issues detected, monitoring recommended
- **üî¥ Critical**: Serious issues, immediate action required

## üõ†Ô∏è Implemented Fixes

### 1. Database Timeout Optimization
- Reduced connection timeout to 15 seconds
- Reduced query timeout to 30 seconds  
- Added AbortSignal with 25-second fetch timeout
- Optimized idle timeout to 20 seconds

### 2. API Request Timeout Handling
- Added 60-second timeout with emergency fix trigger
- Automatic emergency fix for requests taking >30 seconds
- Enhanced error responses with timeout recovery information

### 3. Next.js Configuration Improvements
- Disabled expensive webpack optimizations in development
- Extended onDemandEntries buffer to 15 minutes
- Disabled compression to reduce CPU load
- Added aggressive caching for faster builds

### 4. Automatic Monitoring & Recovery
- Auto-recovery system monitors system health every 30 seconds
- Triggers emergency fixes automatically for critical issues
- Prevents cascading timeout failures

## üìà Performance Monitoring

The system tracks:
- Response times for all API endpoints
- Memory usage and system uptime
- Timeout rates and success rates
- Slow request detection and logging

## üöÄ Prevention Measures

### For Development:
1. The auto-recovery system runs automatically
2. Timeout monitoring logs slow operations
3. Emergency fix can be triggered proactively

### For Production:
- All timeout configurations are optimized for cloud environments
- Database connections use shorter timeouts for faster failure detection
- Request monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks

## üîß Manual Actions

If automatic fixes don't resolve the issue:

1. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   # Kill the current process and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check system resources**:
   - Monitor memory usage in Task Manager/Activity Monitor
   - Close other applications if memory is low

3. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

## üìù Logging & Debugging

The system provides detailed logging for:
- Timeout detection and fixes applied
- Performance metrics and slow operations
- Emergency fix reports and recommendations
- System health assessments

Check the browser console and server logs for detailed information about timeout issues and recovery actions.

## üÜò When to Seek Help

Contact support if:
- Emergency fixes don't resolve timeout issues
- Timeouts persist after server restart
- System health remains "critical" despite fixes
- Performance degrades significantly over time

The timeout fix system is designed to handle most common timeout scenarios automatically, but persistent issues may indicate underlying system or network problems that require manual intervention.
